3.1. **Independent Project:**
    The AdrenoGpuDriver project is an independent initiative developed by Yiğit. This project, its Author (Yiğit), and the Software provided are not affiliated with, associated with, authorized by, endorsed by, sponsored by, or in any way officially connected with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, "Qualcomm").

    The primary purpose of this project is to provide templates, tools, and information to the community for educational and experimental use, enabling users to manage or modify GPU driver installations on their own devices using files they have legitimately sourced. The project itself does not distribute proprietary Qualcomm drivers.

3.3. **Respect for Intellectual Property:**
    The Author respects the intellectual property rights of Qualcomm and others. This project is intended to operate with driver files that users have obtained through legitimate channels (e.g., from their device's official firmware). Users of the Software are solely responsible for ensuring they have the necessary rights and licenses for any driver files they use in conjunction with this Software. The Author does not condone or encourage the unauthorized acquisition or use of copyrighted materials. This project does not aim to fundamentally infringe upon Qualcomm's rights; rather, it provides a framework for users to work with drivers on their own systems.

3.4. **No Qualcomm Proprietary Code Distribution:**
    To the best of the Author's knowledge, this repository does not contain or distribute proprietary, copyrighted code owned by Qualcomm, unless such code is already permissively licensed for redistribution.
