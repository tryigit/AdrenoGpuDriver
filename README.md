# Qualcomm Drivers
The aim of this github project is to create a template that everyone can use. Unfortunately Oems and Qualcomm are very bad at providing drivers for the Adreno gpu.
Currently magisk focused. kernelsu and other root projects may be added in the future. First of all, a/b ota update support is expected.
You can make your own modules using template.

### Two solutions for bootloop and similar problems
+ **Recovery:** Safe Mode
+ **Twrp:** `/data/adb/modules` delete


## Community Created Drivers

To support community drivers, send your own driver modules on this telegram group. I stopped working for the community because I don't like the community.

## Android Native Feature
> [!TIP]
> Did you know that if you have a computer, you can change the drivers for games and apps separately from the android system?

## Driver Update App
> [!WARNING]
> This feature is not supported by older devices.

There are very few people skilled enough to do this, but you can modify the system gpu driver implementation by editing some prop code! So in the future, it is possible to make a Qualcomm independent gpu driver implementation.
```
ro.gfx.driver.0=com.xiaomi.ugd
ro.gfx.driver.1=com.qualcomm.qti.gpudrivers.kalama.api33
```
## Edit Gpu Driver
You need to learn how to use **Adreno Profile Tools**. You can also use Qualcomm official website to download. In general, this template is for drivers extracted from the rom dump.

## Known Issues
- [x] Kernelsu compatibility
- [ ] Magiskhide map conflict
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Temporarily added this prop code `ro.zygote.disable_gl_preload=1` this fixes the magiskhide egl issue but causes other problems* @topjohnwu
